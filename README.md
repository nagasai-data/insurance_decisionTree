🧠 Insurance Claim Prediction using Decision Tree

This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will opt for vehicle insurance, based on features like age, vehicle damage history, gender, and annual premium.

🔍 What I Did

- Cleaned and prepared the raw dataset
- Converted categorical features using label encoding
- Built a Decision Tree model with `sklearn`
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized the confusion matrix with `Seaborn`

🎯 Goal

To explore how Decision Trees can help classify customer insurance decisions based on key behavioral and demographic features. This project builds upon my previous logistic regression implementation.
